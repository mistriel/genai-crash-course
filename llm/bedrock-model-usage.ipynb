    "AWS Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies. It allows you to build and scale generative AI applications using these models. In this notebook, we will explore how to use AWS Bedrock with the `boto3` library in Python."

    "## LLMs and Foundation Models\n",
    "Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are trained on vast amounts of data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. AWS Bedrock provides access to various foundation models, including text generation, image generation, and more. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM is a stateless function. When \"memory\" or \"context\" is required, it is passed as part of the prompt.\n",
    "* The operation of fetching information from a database or other source is called \"retrieval augmentation generation\" (RAG).\n",
    "* The datasource used to fetch information is called a knowledge base.\n",
    "* LLMs [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) depends on the model complexity and the number of tokens (~4 chars ≅ word) in the prompt and the response.\n",
    "* The longer the prompt, the more expensive and the slower it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using AWS Bedrock models and regions\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS LLM models availability is region specific. `us-east-1` or `N. Virginia` is the region where all models are available. </br>\n",
    "In order to use a model of a specific provider, you need to request access to that model in the [Model Access](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/modelaccess) section </br>\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll be using `us-east-1` region with several different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-region inference\n",
    "Cross-region inference is a new AWS feature that enable LLM requests  to be processed in a different geographical region than where the request originated.\n",
    "Instead of being limited to the models and compute resources available in a single region, cross-region inference can automatically route your inference requests to other available regions.\n",
    "You can use the `Inference Profile ID` instead of the `Model ID` to specify the model you want to use. The Inference Profile ID is a unique identifier for a specific model and its associated compute resources in a specific region. </br>\n",
    "For list of available models and their Inference Profile IDs, please refer to the [AWS Cross-region inference Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/inference-profiles).\n",

    "## Conversation API\n",
    "The `conversation` API is used to interact with the LLMs in AWS Bedrock. It allows you to send messages to the model and receive responses. The API supports different roles for the messages, including `user`, `assistant`, and `system`. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `user` role is used for the user's input, the `assistant` role is used for the model's response, and the `system` role is used for system messages that provide context or instructions to the model. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Parameters\n",
    "* `modelId`: The ID of the model you want to use. This can be either the model ID or the Inference Profile ID.\n",
    "* `messages`: A list of messages to send to the model. Each message should include a `role` and `content`.\n",
    "* `inferenceConfig`: A dictionary of inference configuration options, such as `maxTokens`, `stopSequences`, `temperature`, and `topP`.\n",
    "*  `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8) makes the output more random, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) makes it more deterministic.\n",
    "* `topP`: It sets a threshold probability and selects the top tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold. The model then randomly samples from this set of tokens to generate output. This method can produce more diverse and interesting output than traditional methods that randomly sample the entire vocabulary."

    "## Prompt Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching is a powerful feature in Amazon Bedrock that significantly reduces response latency for workloads with repetitive contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Prompt Caching?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching allows you to store portions of your conversation context, enabling models to:\n",
    "- Reuse cached context instead of reprocessing inputs\n",
    "- Reduce response Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for subsequent queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Prompt Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching delivers maximum benefits for:\n",
    "- **Chat with Document**: By caching the document as input context on the first request, each user query becomes more efficient, perhaps enabling simpler architectures that avoid heavier solutions like vector databases.\n",
    "- **Coding assistants**: Reusing long code files in prompts enables near real-time inline suggestions, eliminating much of the time spent reprocessing code files.\n",
    "- **Agentic workflows**: Longer system prompts can be used to refine agent behavior without degrading the end-user experience. By caching the system prompts and complex tool definitions, the time to process each step in the agentic flow can be reduced.\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Learning**: Including numerous high-quality examples and complex instructions, such as for customer service or technical troubleshooting, can benefit from prompt caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Prompt Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Response Times**: Avoid reprocessing the same context repeatedly\n",
    "- **Improved User Experience**: Reduced TTFT to create more natural conversations\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially lower token usage by avoiding redundant processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Support\n",
    "Be advised that the prompt caching feature is model-specific. You should review the [supported models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html#prompt-caching-models) and details on the minimum number of tokens per cache checkpoint and maximum number of cache checkpoints per request\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching works by storing the context of the conversation in a cache. When a new request is made, the model checks if the context is already in the cache. If it is, the model uses the cached context instead of reprocessing the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, a prompt is an array of messages. A message can be marked as a cache checkpoint. Once a message is marked as a cache checkpoint,\n",
    "The **entire section of the prompt preceding the checkpoint then becomes the cached prompt prefix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when the model processes a new request, that includes the all the prompt, it will not process the messages that are part of the cached prompt prefix, it will only need to process the messages that follow the checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prompt Caching](../resources/images/prompt-caching-aws-bedrock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates how cache hits work. A, B, C, D represent distinct portions of the prompt. A, B and C are marked as the prompt prefix. Cache hits occur when subsequent requests contain the same A, B, C prompt prefix.\n",
    "\n",

    "    I will provide you with the Terms of Use document of a specific website, followed by a question about its content. Your task is to analyze the Terms of Use, extract relevant information, and provide a comprehensive answer to the question. Please follow these detailed instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Identifying Relevant Clauses (Quotes):\n",
    "       - Carefully read through the entire Terms of Use document.\n",
    "       - Identify sections or clauses of the text that are directly relevant to answering the question.\n",
    "       - Pay special attention to definitions, user obligations, disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, governing law, dispute resolution, and any clauses related to the specific query.\n",
    "       - Select quotes that provide key information, context, or support for the answer. These are typically specific clauses or parts of clauses.\n",
    "       - Quotes should be concise and to the point, ideally no more than 2-4 sentences each, capturing the core of the relevant legal statement.\n",
    "       - Choose a diverse range of quotes if multiple clauses address different aspects of the question.\n",
    "       - Aim to select between 2 to 5 quotes, depending on the complexity of the question and the structure of the Terms of Use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Presenting the Relevant Clauses:\n",
    "       - List the selected quotes under the heading 'Relevant clauses:'\n",
    "       - Number each quote sequentially, starting from [1].\n",
    "       - Present each quote exactly as it appears in the original text, enclosed in quotation marks.\n",
    "       - If no relevant clauses can be found to directly answer the question, write 'No directly relevant clauses found' instead.\n",
    "       - Example format:\n",
    "         Relevant clauses:\n",
    "         [1] \"Users agree not to use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.\"\n",
    "         [2] \"The Company reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Formulating the Answer:\n",
    "       - Begin your answer with the heading 'Answer:' on a new line after the quotes.\n",
    "       - Provide a clear, concise, and accurate answer to the question based on the information in the Terms of Use.\n",
    "       - Ensure your answer is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the question.\n",
    "       - Use information from the quoted clauses to support your answer, but rephrase and explain the implications rather than repeating them verbatim.\n",
    "       - Where possible, explain any legal jargon or complex phrasing in simpler terms, while remaining faithful to the original meaning of the clause.\n",
    "       - Maintain a logical flow and structure in your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Referencing Clauses in the Answer:\n",
    "       - Do not explicitly mention or introduce quotes in your answer (e.g., avoid phrases like 'According to clause [1]').\n",
    "       - Instead, add the bracketed number of the relevant quote at the end of each sentence or point that uses information from that clause.\n",
    "       - If a sentence or point is supported by multiple clauses, include all relevant quote numbers.\n",
    "       - Example: 'The website prohibits users from engaging in unlawful activities. [1] Furthermore, the platform can suspend user accounts without prior notification if terms are violated. [2]'\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Handling Ambiguity or Lack of Specific Information:\n",
    "       - If the Terms of Use do not contain enough specific information to fully answer the question, or if a clause is ambiguous, clearly state this in your answer.\n",
    "       - Provide any partial information that is available, and explain what aspects are not explicitly covered or remain unclear.\n",
    "       - If there are multiple possible interpretations of a clause relevant to the question, explain this and provide answers based on plausible interpretations if possible, noting the ambiguity.\n",
    "       - State clearly that the analysis is based *only* on the provided text and cannot infer unstated terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Maintaining Objectivity and Disclaimer:\n",
    "       - Stick to the facts and statements presented in the Terms of Use document. Do not include personal opinions, interpretations beyond the text, or external information not found in the document.\n",
    "       - Your analysis is for informational purposes only and should NOT be considered legal advice. Always recommend consulting with a legal professional for specific advice regarding Terms of Use.\n",
    "       - If the document presents one-sided or particularly restrictive terms, you can note this objectively in your answer without endorsing or refuting the legal validity or fairness of such terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Formatting and Style:\n",
    "       - Use clear paragraph breaks to separate different points or aspects of your answer.\n",
    "       - Employ bullet points or numbered lists if it helps to organize information about specific rights, obligations, or restrictions more clearly.\n",
    "       - Ensure proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling throughout your response.\n",
    "       - Maintain a professional, neutral, and informative tone throughout your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8. Length and Depth:\n",
    "       - Provide an answer that is sufficiently detailed to address the question comprehensively based on the Terms of Use.\n",
    "       - However, avoid unnecessary verbosity. Aim for clarity and conciseness, focusing on the aspects most relevant to the user's query.\n",
    "       - The length of your answer should be proportional to the complexity of the question and the amount of relevant information within the Terms of Use.\n",
    "\n",
    "    9. Dealing with Complex or Multi-part Questions about Terms:\n",
    "       - For questions with multiple parts (e.g., 'What are the user's rights regarding data privacy and what is the process for account termination?'), address each part separately and clearly.\n",
    "       - Use subheadings or numbered points to break down your answer if necessary, ensuring each component of the query is addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    10. Concluding the Answer:\n",
    "        - If appropriate, provide a brief summary of the key findings from the Terms of Use related to the question.\n",
    "        - Reiterate that the information is based solely on the provided document and is not legal advice. If the question implies seeking guidance (e.g., 'Should I be concerned about X clause?'), frame the answer by explaining what the clause means according to the text, rather than advising on concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remember, your goal is to provide a clear, accurate, and well-supported analysis based solely on the content of the given Terms of Use document. Adhere to these instructions carefully to ensure a high-quality response that effectively addresses the user's query about the website's terms.\n",
