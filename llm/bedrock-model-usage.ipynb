    "## LLMs and Foundation Models\n",
    "Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are trained on vast amounts of data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. AWS Bedrock provides access to various foundation models, including text generation, image generation, and more. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM is a stateless function. When \"memory\" or \"context\" is required, it is passed as part of the prompt.\n",
    "* The operation of fetching information from a database or other source is called \"retrieval augmentation generation\" (RAG).\n",
    "* The datasource used to fetch information is called a knowledge base.\n",
    "* LLMs [pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) depends on the model complexity and the number of tokens (~4 chars ≅ word) in the prompt and the response.\n",
    "* The longer the prompt, the more expensive and the slower it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using AWS Bedrock models and regions\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS LLM models availability is region specific. `us-east-1` or `N. Virginia` is the region where all models are available. </br>\n",
    "In order to use a model of a specific provider, you need to request access to that model in the [Model Access](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/modelaccess) section </br>\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll be using `us-east-1` region with several different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-region inference\n",
    "Cross-region inference is a new AWS feature that enable LLM requests  to be processed in a different geographical region than where the request originated.\n",
    "Instead of being limited to the models and compute resources available in a single region, cross-region inference can automatically route your inference requests to other available regions.\n",
    "You can use the `Inference Profile ID` instead of the `Model ID` to specify the model you want to use. The Inference Profile ID is a unique identifier for a specific model and its associated compute resources in a specific region. </br>\n",
    "For list of available models and their Inference Profile IDs, please refer to the [AWS Cross-region inference Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/inference-profiles).\n",
