    "# LangChain\n",
    "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. </br>\n",
    "It provides a standard interface for working with different LLM models, as well as tools for chaining together multiple LLM calls, managing memory, and more. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Standard Interface**: LangChain provides a consistent interface for working with different LLMs, making it easier to switch between models.\n",
    "- **Chaining**: You can chain together multiple LLM calls to create complex workflows.\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: LangChain provides tools for managing memory, allowing you to store and retrieve information across multiple LLM calls.\n",
    "- **Tools and Utilities**: LangChain includes a variety of tools and utilities for working with LLMs, such as tokenizers, embeddings, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "LangChain's architecture is designed to be modular and extensible. It consists of several main packages:\n",
    "- **Core**: The core package provides the basic building blocks for working with LLMs, including the standard interface and utilities for chaining and memory management.\n",
    "- **langchain**: This package contains the main LangChain functionality, including the standard interface for LLMs, tools for chaining, and memory management.\n",
    "- **langchain_community**: This package contains community-contributed tools and utilities for working with LLMs, such as additional tokenizers, embeddings, and more.\n",
    "- **Integrations**: LangChain integrates with various LLM providers, allowing you to easily switch between different vendors.\n",

    "## Prompt Templates\n",
    "Prompt templates are a way to define the structure of a prompt that will be sent to an LLM. </br>\n",
    "They allow you to create reusable templates that can be filled in with specific values at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Prompt Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Prompt Template**: A basic template that takes a single input and generates a prompt.\n",
    "- **Chat Prompt Template**: A template designed for chat-based interactions, allowing for multiple messages and roles.\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Prompt Template**: A template that includes examples of input-output pairs to guide the LLM's response.\n",
    "- **Custom Prompt Template**: A template that allows for more complex structures and custom formatting.\n",
    "- **Prompt Template with Variables**: A template that includes variables that can be filled in with specific values at runtime.\n",
    "- **Prompt Template with Conditionals**: A template that includes conditional logic to generate different prompts based on specific conditions."

    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a RAG application typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Document Loading**: Load documents from various sources (e.g., web pages, documents, databases) that contain relevant information.\n",
    "2. **Chunking**: Split the loaded documents into smaller, manageable chunks to facilitate efficient retrieval.\n",
    "3. **Embedding Creation**: Generate embeddings for the document chunks using a suitable embedding model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "4. **Vector Store Creation**: Store the embeddings in a vector store (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) to enable efficient similarity search.\n",
    "5. **Retriever Creation**: Create a retriever that can query the vector store to find relevant document chunks based on user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings and Vector Stores\n",
    "Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. </br>\n",
    "In order to create an embedding vector, we use a LLM to convert text into a high-dimensional vector space where similar texts are closer together. </br>\n",

    "### Retrieval and generation\n",

    "When using trying to find similar documents, we use a retriever to search the vector store for relevant chunks based on the user's query. </br>\n",
    "For that the query is also converted into an embedding vector using the same embedding model. </br>\n",
    "Now that we have both chunks and query in the same vector space, we can find the most similar chunks to the query. </br>\n",

    "Chains in LangChain allow you to create complex workflows by chaining together multiple operations, such as document retrieval, text processing, and LLM generation. </br>\n",

    "When you write `component_a` | `component_b`, it means \"take the output of `component_a` and pass it as the input to `component_b`.\" </br>\n",

    "This makes building complex LLM applications (like RAG chains) much more readable and modular.\n",
    "Each \"component\" in an LCEL chain (like retriever, prompt, llm, StrOutputParser) is typically an instance of a Runnable object. LangChain's Runnable classes define the __or__ method, which is what allows this chaining syntax to work.\n"
